 If you've found a bug and would like to fix it or add a feature, Id love you to. Modify the code and create a PR.

 1. Due to the urgency of the project, it's not fully responsive. I'm currently working on that for mobile users. (* ***solved***)

 1. When you click a category, I would love for the focus to remain on the clicked category. I'm tweaking that to make it easier for users.
